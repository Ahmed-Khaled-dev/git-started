Let me show you around our time machine. 
This blue box (main.cpp) is our IDE (like visual studio), where you will be able to write code.
The black box you see on your screen (the console) is your tool to tell Git what to do.
but be aware!
GIT will not understand what you wish to do unless you communicate to it in a special syntax (like programming languages).

After showing you around, let’s start our adventure by telling you how to use GIT to do something.
We use GIT commands!
“Commands” are a set of instructions, each one of them is responsible for making a certain job. 
We will start with our first command “Git init”. 
Git init tells GIT to start watching your current folder which we call a git repository (repo for short). You won't be able to tell git anything unless you initialize a repository. That’s why “Git init” has to be the first command to be executed. 
Let’s try executing it together. Please type “git init” in the command line (the black box) -c
(head appears)
Would you look at that!! That’s GIT's head (Now git has its eyes on you)
It will accompany you throughout the game. You will get to know more about the "GIT head" in the upcoming levels
