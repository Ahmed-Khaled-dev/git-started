Look at all the commits you have; you must be proud of yourself!
Now as mentioned before our friend (the Head) is looking at the latest commit that we created.
But now you need to look at a previous checkpoint of your code, what do we need to do?
We just need to move the Head to the commit we want, it's that simple!
Each commit has a specified number to show it, this number is called "commit hash"
We will use a new command which is (git checkout <commit hash>)
Now, we want to checkout to our first commit.
Write in the console: "git checkout" and the "hash" of that commit. (-c)
As you can see in the edit menu, 
Your code has changed to what you first wrote in the previous level!
Now let's checkout again to our last commit.
Here you have your latest code again!
The "git checkout" command has a lot of benefits that you will discover more into the next levels.
