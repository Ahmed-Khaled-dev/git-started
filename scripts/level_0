Announcer of a programming competition (This should be added in the place of the word mentor, as a title in the dialogue, not in the dialogue it self)
and last place goes to (player's name)
You are devastated but you saw it coming, because your team's code was full of errors and was disorganized
Suddenly! (we could suddenly show the mentor and do a specific sound)
Someone appears in front of you, they look similar to you but older
Mentor (This should be added as a title in the dialogue, not in the dialogue it self)
Hello (player's name), I am you but from the future, I finally succeeded in going back in time to help you learn from your...umm our mistakes
I remember this day clearly, I was filled with disappointment because of my failure but fear not, I am here to introduce you to a system that changed my life.
I am talking about “GIT”
“GIT” is a free version control system% . You may be wondering, what is a version control system?
As the name implies, it is a tool that tracks all versions of your code and prevents the loss of any code you have written.
It has useful features that help us in working with others simultaneously and efficiently.
I will take you back with my time machine to the start of the contest and walk you through all the GIT features/commands.
I will teach you everything I know so you can start your project again with GIT and have a shot in winning this contest
Are you ready to Git started?
