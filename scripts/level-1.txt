Let me show you around our time machine. 
This blue box (main.cpp) is our IDE (like visual studio), where you will be able to write code.
The black box you see on your screen (the console) is your tool to tell Git what to do. but be aware!
(if we finish the design we can say "this black box above me: (since the sprite will be below the console))
GIT will not obey your orders unless you communicate to it in a special syntax (like programming languages).
After showing you around, let’s start our adventure by telling you how to order GIT to do something.
We use GIT commands!
"Commands" are a set of instructions, each one of them is used to order GIT to do a certain job. 
We will start with our first command "git init". 

Git init orders GIT to start watching your current folder
After git starts watching your folder, your folder is now called a git repository (repo for short). 
You wont be able to order git to do anything unless you initialize a repository
That’s why "git init" has to be the first command to be executed. 
Let’s try executing it together, Please type "git init" in the command line (the black box) -c
(head appears)
Would you look at that!! That’s GIT's head (Now git has it's eyes on you) (we can add fun creepy music in here).
It will accompany you throughout the game. You will get to know more about the "GIT head" in the upcoming levels
