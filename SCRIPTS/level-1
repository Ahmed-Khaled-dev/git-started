Let me show you around our time machine. 
This is the edit window, where you will write the code you want.
This is the command line window, where you will write the suitable “GIT” commands for your code
This is your git graph, it is a diagram that shows how the commands are translated and makes it easier to understand how they work.
After showing you around, let’s start our adventure by telling you what the word “command” means in “GIT”. 
“Commands” are a set of lines, each one of them is responsible for making a certain job. 
We will start with our first command “Git init”.

Git init is responsible for making a new Git folder which we call a repository. Most of our git commands won’t work unless we initialize a repository. That’s why “Git init” has to be the first command to be executed. 
Let’s try executing it together.
