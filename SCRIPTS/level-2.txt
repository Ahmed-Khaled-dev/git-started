Now that you've created your first repository, you'll start by writing your code.
Throughout each step, you will need to keep track of your history.
That's where "commits" come in hand.
"commits" are like checkpoints of your code.
We will use the "git commit -m <commit_message>" command.
But first, let's write some code together!
In the "main.cpp" edit window, we need to write code using C++
For example, try writing: "int i = 5;"
Now you need to commit your changes.
In the command line write: git commit -m "First Variable!"
Congratulations! you have just written your first commit.
It's your turn to write another piece of code and commit your changes!
