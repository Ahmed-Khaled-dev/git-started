## üìù About
This repo contains all the code related to our 2023 Structured Programming course project in Faculty of Computer Science - Ain shams university


**Git started** is an interactive **educational story game** that helps students/developers **learn Git** in an easy and fun way!

The game aims to help beginners memorize git commands, visualize internal git structures and most importantly understand them.

And all of this happens while being **guided by a tutor** character throughout the game.

- #### [Trailer video/More details](https://www.facebook.com/100005920653093/videos/818662826092485/)

The whole game is made without a game engine, only using C++ and [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
