## 📝 About
This repo contains all the code related to the **2023 Structured Programming course project** for Team Gen_64 in **FCIS ASU**


**Git started** is an educational + interactive story game that helps new people/students who are looking to **learn git**, to have the chance to do it while playing a game and having fun at the same time.


The game aims to help beginners memorize git commands, visualize internal git structures and most importantly understand them.


And all of this happens while being **guided by a tutor** character throughout the game.
